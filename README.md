# Simple ReAct Agent from Scratch

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to build a Simple ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) Agent using OpenAI's API. The project is based on a practical approach to integrate reasoning capabilities with actionable steps in AI agents.

# üìã Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a lightweight ReAct agent that interacts with the OpenAI API, specifically the gpt-3.5-turbo model, to perform tasks that require both reasoning and acting in a structured manner. This tutorial-style notebook serves as an educational resource for understanding how to implement such agents from scratch.

# üß© Why Use This Agent?

Traditional AI agents often struggle to combine logical reasoning with actionable outputs in real-world scenarios. The ReAct pattern addresses this challenge by allowing agents to:

Reason: Analyze and infer based on the given context.

Act: Take appropriate steps to perform tasks or answer queries effectively.

By following this approach, you can create more efficient and adaptable AI agents that go beyond static responses.

# üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Python: The core programming language.

OpenAI API: For leveraging the gpt-3.5-turbo model.

httpx: For handling HTTP requests.

dotenv: For managing environment variables securely.

# üìö Key Components

API Integration: The notebook shows how to connect to OpenAI's chat completion API.

Environment Management: It uses dotenv to handle API keys securely.

Reasoning and Acting Logic: Implements the core ReAct pattern for agents to reason through problems and take actions based on their reasoning.

# ‚úÖ Problem Solved

Many AI models are great at generating responses but fall short when it comes to real-time decision-making and actions. The ReAct agent overcomes this by combining logical inference with task execution, making AI interactions more practical and human-like.

# Disadvantages Overcome:

Static Responses: Traditional chatbots give static responses without context-driven actions. The ReAct pattern ensures dynamic, context-aware outputs.

Limited Problem-Solving: This approach enables agents to handle complex, multi-step problems by reasoning through them before acting.
